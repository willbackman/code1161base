"""Refactoring.

This excercise is very similar to week 2, exercise 2. It contains a complete
and working example, but it's very poorly written.

Your job is to go through it and make it as good as you can.

That means making it self-documenting wherever possible, adding comments where
it isn't. Take repeated code and make it into a function. Also use functions
to encapsulate concepts. If something is done many times, maybe a map or a loop
is called for. Etc.

The resulting file should read as close to english as possible.
It must also pass the linter.
